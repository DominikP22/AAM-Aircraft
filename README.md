# AAM-Aircraft
Advanced air mobility aircraft designed with the mission of transporting four passengers between cities on short flights.


This project was a part of my third year aircraft design course. The task was to design a small aircraft which transports passengers between cities. 
One of primary components of the project was to perform initial sizing calculations. This included a weight estimation, performance selection, and load requirements. 

The second portion of the project was to create a CAD model and drawings illustrating the desing with proper dimensions.
